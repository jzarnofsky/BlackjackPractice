We want to:
--    Read the equation from a file
--    Print the answer to a file
    Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division:
--        On two numbers
--        On a sequence of numbers
--    Be able to use the previous answer in subsequent equations
--    Get record of the equation as processed
--  Allow Decimal points

--    For now, we will process the equation from left to right
--        Order of Operations will come later

--    We're going to expect equations to be written using the following symbols:
--      +  -  /  *

    Later, we're going to add the following
--        Square
--        Square root
--        Variable Exponent
--        Variable root
